optLBFGS
========

Matlab code for the Limited-memory BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) algorithm.

1. Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) is an optimization algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods that approximates the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm using a limited amount of computer memory. It is a popular algorithm for parameter estimation in machine learning.

2. I use line search algorithm satisfying strong Wolfe conditions.
More details can be found from Algorithms 3.2 on page 59 in Numerical Optimization, by Nocedal and Wright

3. In example.m, Both optLBFGS and minFunc are used in solving 2 optimization problems(myfun and rosenbrock, the 2D Rosenbrock "banana" function). I believe optLBFGS has similar performance with minFunc( with limited-memory BFGS - default) in most of the cases.
